# Louis


Platform for learning Braille while using VoiceOver and a Braille display. Louis utilizes the accessibility features built into iOS. Louis can also be used by sighted individuals to visually learn Braille.

## Braille Display
This is a device connected via Bluetooth to an iOS device that displays Braille. Through VoiceOver functionality, all items can be heard and accessed.

## Methods
This software was developed in the Netherlands.

* Met punt op pad (for children)
* Maréchal (for adults)

<!--
## Localization
Methods are stored on a server. Therefore, they can easily be modified or added when needed. The audio files must be downloaded once. During installation, English or Dutch files are downloaded.
-->

## How to Use
1. Connect the Braille display via Bluetooth. Turn on the Braille display and ensure it’s connected to your iOS device.
2. Turn off silent mode (left switch on iPhone).
3. Adjust the volume level.
4. Enable VoiceOver.
5. Mute the VoiceOver voice (double-tap with three fingers on the screen).
6. If that doesn't work, go to your device's accessibility settings.
